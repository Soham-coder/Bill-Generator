# Problem

*Today, whenever customers purchase something, ask for a bill or cash-memo in order to further inquiry for product related issues*.
*For local shops, It takes a lot of time to create an excel sheet and make a cash-memo/bill. So we came up with a solution where the shopkeeper just needs to enter the data and the bill will automatically be generated through the script*.
*In this tutorial we learn, How to develop this kind of GUI to generate bills*.
